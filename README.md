# UnrealEngine-4-BattleTanks

This project serves as my first major plunge into the [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) framework. I managed to create a fully functional object interaction system, similar to that of [Gone Home](https://gonehome.game/) or [Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim?). It was designed in such a way that any static mesh added to the scene can become interactable. This will serve usefull later, as I'm still in the process of creating an immersive 3D environment using community assets/Unreal starter Content. I still need to flesh out this appartment and it's surroundings and inject some more puzzels into the game. Currently, the only door in the environment serves as a puzzle based of the amount of weight that a trigger box detects. Below are some screens as well as an inital video to demonstrate project status.
