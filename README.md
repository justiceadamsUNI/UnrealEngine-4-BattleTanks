# UnrealEngine-4-BattleTanks

This project is my main focus as I work within [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4). I plan on developing a fully functioning tank experience complete with advanced AI and later on multiplayer support. Additionally, I plan on expanding it with a full 3D setting to expand upon the current setting. You'll notice that the environment is strictly green and blue to indicate where I want to place foliage/water later down the line.
This is a WIP!
